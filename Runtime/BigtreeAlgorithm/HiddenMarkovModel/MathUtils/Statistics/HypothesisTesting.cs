    /// Hypothesis testing framework:
    /// 1. Start with a null hypothesis (null_value) that represents the status quo (i.e. common believe).
    /// 2. Create an alternative hypothesis (H_A) that represents the research questions, i.e. what is being tested for.
    /// 3. Conduct a hypothesis test under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, either via simulation or theoretical methods (i.e. methods that rely on Central Limit Theorem)
    /// 4. If thte test results suggest that the data do not provide convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis, we stick with the null hypothesis. If the do, then we reject 
    /// the null hyptothesis in favor of the alternative
    /// 
    /// p-value = P(observed or more extreme outcome | null_value true)
    /// p-value is the probability of observing data at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as our current data set, if the null hyptothesis was true
    /// 1. If the p-value is low (lower than the significance level, alpha, which is usually 5%) we say the it would be very unlikely to observe the data if the null hypothesis were true, and hence reject H_0
    /// 2. If the p-value is high (higher than alpha) we say that is likely to observe the data even if the null hypothesis were true, and hence do not reject H_0
    /// 
    /// Steps for Hypothesis testing for a single mean:
    /// 1. Set the hypotheses: H_0: mu = null value
    ///                        H_A: mu < or > or != null value
    /// 2. Calculate the point estimate (usually the sample mean)
    /// 3. Check CLT (i.e., Central Limit Theorem) condictions:
    ///   I. Independence: Sampled observations must be independent (random sample/assignment & if sampling without replacement, n < 10% of population)
    ///   II. Sample size/skew: n>=30, larger if the population distribution is very skewed
    /// 4. Draw sample distribution, shade p-value, calculate test statistics Z = (point_estimate - null_value) / SE
    /// 5. Make a decision, and interpret it in context of the research question:
    ///   if p-value < alpha, reject H_0; the data provide convincing evidence for H_A
    ///   if p-value > alpha, do not reject H_0; the data do not provide convincing evidence for H_A
    ///   
    /// There are two types of decision errors in hypothesis testing:
    /// Type I error is rejecting H_0 when H_0 is true
    /// Type II error is failing to reject H_0 when H_A is true
    /// (Usually from a social point of view, Type I error is the worst error as it means rejecting something that is true and status quo, but this depends on scenario and personal preferences)
    /// By definition:
    /// P(Type I error | H_0 is true) = alpha, where alpha is the significance_level => prefer small significance level, increasing significance level increases the Type I error rate.
    /// On the other hand, decreasing significance_level increases the Type II error
    /// 
    /// The power of a test is the probability of correctly reject H_0, the probability of doing so is (1-beta), where beta = P(Type II error | H_A is true)
    /// beta depends on the effect size, which is the difference between point estimate and the null_value => if the effect size is large, then beta is small
    /// 
    /// Real differences between the point estimate and null_value are easier to detect with larger sample. However, very large samples will result in a statistical significance even
    /// for tiny differences between sample mean (i.e. point estimate) and the null value (the difference refers to the effect size), even when the difference is not practically significant.
    /// 
    /// Note that in case the sample size is smaller than 30, the CLT does not hold and Student's t distribution should be used for the population statistics instead of normal distribution
