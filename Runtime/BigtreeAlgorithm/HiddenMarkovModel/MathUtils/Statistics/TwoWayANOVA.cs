    /// This implements the two way ANOVA
    /// The main difference is that instead of investigating the fixed/random effect of a continuous variable based on group,
    /// two different type of groups are analyzed for the continuous variable. In this case, for each data record, the value of the variable is associated with 
    /// two different group levels. For example, suppose the variable is "Score", and the two groups are "Gender" and "Race", then each score is associated with 
    /// a gender group id and a race group id, and we have variable = "Score" grpCat1 = "Gender", grpCat2 = "Race" 
    /// 
    /// Now we will have the grpCat1, grpCat2, and interaction(grpCat1, grpCat2) = grpCat1 * grpCat2, correspondingly we will have 3 different p-values and F-critic
    /// 
    /// ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) can be used for comparing more than two means
    /// 
    /// The hypotheses in ANOVA:
    /// H_0: mu_1 = mu_2 = ... = mu_k (where k is the number of groups or classes)
    /// H_A: at least one pair of means are different from each other.
    /// 
    /// anova compares means from more than two groups: are they so far apart that the observed differences cannot all reasonably be attributed to sampling variability
    /// 
    /// Conditions for ANOVA
    /// 1. Independence: 
    ///   within groups: sampled observations must be independent 
    ///     > random sample/assignment
    ///     > each group size less than 10% of respective population
    ///   between groups: the groups must be independent of each other (non-paired)
    /// 2. Approximate normality: distributions should be nearly normal within each group
    /// 3. Equal variance: groups should have roughly equal variability
    /// 
    /// Applications in regression model:
    /// Suppose we have an attribute (e.g., a predictor) in a data table which is categorical, and we want to check whether its values has effect (i.e. predicts) another attributes (e.g. the response variable)
    /// we can use the value of the attribute as the class labels and the corresponding response variable value in the same data row as the value. In other words, we can group the response variable values by
    /// classes in the categorical attributes. Now if we want to find out whether the attributes has predictive power on the response variable, we can form the H_0 and H_A => if H_0 is rejected, then the
    /// categorical attribute has predictive power over the response variable => good for predictor selection in regression models.
